		<h2>Parents & Teachers</h2>
		<p>
		Following the Scope and Sequence Guidelines of New York State, <b>Puppetry Arts in Education</b> workshops for grades <b>K-4</b> help improve literacy oral language skills by linking language and content through hands-on puppet making projects. In many cases, these projects help supplement the lack of positive reinforcement of the curriculum by parents. </br></br>

		Workshops for grades <b>5-12</b> help infuse the curriculum through group projects through projects in puppetry theatre. While inducing New York State learning standards, students benefit from activities that model positive social interaction and that encourage language development and social skills to succeed in mainstream classrooms to become life-long learners.</br></br></p>

		<div class="workshop"> Workshops are funded through matching grant programs.  </div>

		</br>
		<p>Puppetry Arts does not host birthday parties but performers and teachers are available to visit an event held at your home or facility within Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens. Programs and events can be offered outside of the 3 Boroughs with additional fees.</p>
