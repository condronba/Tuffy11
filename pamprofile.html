			Getting Tuffy ready for school, making his peanut butter sandwiches, 
			and reading to him at night, Miss Pam is a loving mommy to the little orange tiger. 
			As Tuffy discovers the world around him she is always by his side. 
			Nestled in a big oak tree, Tuffy and his friends share their adventures in the pastel-colored tree house in Miss Pamâ€™s backyard.
