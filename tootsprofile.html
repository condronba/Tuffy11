				Toots is an active team player in all of the adventures in the tree house. 
				Never without his fish bowl over his head, Toots is playful and always on his feet, 
				or fins for that matter, bouncing from one idea to the next. 
				Though he cannot speak, he makes a bubbly sound from inside his bowl, giving him his beloved nickname. 
				Affectionate and always with a smile, Toots never feels like a fish out of water.
